There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  My Words

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  The first edition of the product is intended for school pupils that read and learn new words.
  Future additional features beyond the mvp may include word games to practise these new words.
  They will use My Words to look up the definition of a new word that they come across.
  

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  My Words is intended to support the learning of new vocabulary for a school pupil.
  Having a record of their newly searched words should encourage them to use these words in their work so that they gain practice using these words.
  The application will save a record of their looked up words so that they can refer to them later on, say if they want to use those words in an essay or other assignment.
  Later additions - time permitting - will allow learners of foreign languages to look up new words in the language they learn; My Words will keep a record of these so that they can refer to them later on.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  My Words hopes to support a pupil's growing vocabulary, by making it easy to search and save a list of words.
  


## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  People often forget many things that they learn and having a persistent list makes it easy for a person to refer to so that it jogs their memory.


## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Never stop learning and never forget what you learn! Our product takes care of the 'forget' part.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  The architecture is a standard client-server-database relationship, along with a relationship with Oxford Dictionary's API for making GET requests for the definition of words.
  Oxford Dictionary's API includes dictionarys for the English languages as well as other languages so it should be doable to utilise additional dictionaries if time permits for foreign language dictionary features.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I had a hard time remembering all the new words that I learned from reading. I find it fun now to read because I know that I can learn new words, and refer to my own list to use them and impress my parents and teachers."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Try typing in a word in the search field. It will give you the definition, along with examples of how to use the word if there are any.
